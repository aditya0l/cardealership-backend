## 🧪 **Post-Deployment Testing**

### **Test Plan:**

**Once Render shows "Deploy live", run these tests:**

#### **Test 1: Health Check**
```bash
curl https://automotive-backend-frqe.onrender.com/health
# Expected: 200 OK
```

#### **Test 2: Bulk Assign**
```bash
curl -X POST https://automotive-backend-frqe.onrender.com/api/bookings/bulk-assign \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bookingIds": ["booking1"],
    "advisorId": "advisor-uid",
    "reason": "Test"
  }'
# Expected: 200 OK with assignment data
```

#### **Test 3: Auto-Assign**
```bash
curl -X POST https://automotive-backend-frqe.onrender.com/api/bookings/auto-assign \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bookingIds": ["booking1", "booking2"],
    "strategy": "ROUND_ROBIN"
  }'
# Expected: 200 OK with distribution summary
```

#### **Test 4: Unassign**
```bash
curl -X PATCH https://automotive-backend-frqe.onrender.com/api/bookings/booking1/unassign \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Test"}'
# Expected: 200 OK, advisorId = null
```

#### **Test 5: Template Download**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://automotive-backend-frqe.onrender.com/api/bookings/import/template?includeAdvisors=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  --output template.xlsx
# Expected: Excel file downloaded
```

## 🎯 **Frontend Testing**

**After backend is live, test in dashboard:**

1. **Bulk Assignment:**
   - Go to Bookings page
   - Select 2-3 bookings
   - Click "Bulk Assign"
   - Choose advisor
   - Click "Assign"
   - ✅ Should work without 404 error

2. **Auto-Assignment:**
   - Select multiple unassigned bookings
   - Click "Auto-Assign"
   - Choose strategy (e.g., "Least Load")
   - Click "Auto-Assign"
   - ✅ Should distribute bookings

3. **Unassign:**
   - Open a booking with an advisor
   - Click action menu → "Unassign"
   - ✅ Advisor should be removed

4. **Template Download:**
   - Go to Bulk Import page
   - Click "Download Template"
   - ✅ Excel file should download with advisor list

---

## 📊 **Monitoring**

### **Check Render Logs:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for:
   ```
   [INFO] Starting deployment...
   [INFO] Building...
   [INFO] Build successful
   [INFO] Deploying...
   [INFO] Deploy live
   ```

### **Check for Errors:**
Look for any error messages like:
```
[ERROR] Module not found
[ERROR] Cannot find module 'exceljs'
[ERROR] Syntax error
```

If you see errors, they're usually:
- Missing dependencies (run `npm install exceljs`)
- TypeScript errors (check linter)

---

## 🔧 **Rollback Plan (If Needed)**

If deployment fails or has issues:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert a25974a
git push origin main

# Or reset to previous commit
git reset --hard 3c42c7c
git push origin main --force
```

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

Deployment is successful when:

- [ ] Render shows "Deploy live"
- [ ] Health check returns 200
- [ ] All 4 new endpoints return 200 (not 404)
- [ ] Frontend can bulk assign without errors
- [ ] Frontend can auto-assign without errors
- [ ] Frontend can unassign without errors
- [ ] Template downloads successfully

---

## 📞 **If Issues Occur**

### **Issue: Build fails on Render**
**Solution:** Check Render logs for error message, usually missing dependency

### **Issue: Still getting 404 after deploy**
**Solution:** 
1. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for Render to fully restart
3. Check Render logs to confirm deployment actually completed

### **Issue: 500 Internal Server Error**
**Solution:** Check Render logs for stack trace, likely TypeScript error

---

## 🎉 **Expected Timeline**

- ✅ **Now:** Code pushed to GitHub
- 🟡 **+1 min:** Render detects push, starts build
- 🟡 **+2-3 min:** Building dependencies, compiling TypeScript
- 🟡 **+4-5 min:** Deploying to production
- ✅ **+5-6 min:** Deploy live, endpoints available

**Total:** ~5-6 minutes from push to live

---

## 📝 **Next Steps After Deployment**

1. Wait for "Deploy live" on Render
2. Test endpoints with curl or Postman
3. Test dashboard buttons
4. If all works: ✅ DONE!
5. If issues: Check logs and troubleshoot
