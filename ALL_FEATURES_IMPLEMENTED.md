## 🎯 **What Was Implemented**

### 1️⃣ **Custom Employee ID System** ✅

**Before:**
```
Employee ID: kryTfSsgR7MRqZW5qYMGE9liI9s1
(Random Firebase UID - hard to remember/use)
```

**After:**
```
Employee IDs:
- Admin: ADM001, ADM002, ADM003
- General Manager: GM001, GM002
- Sales Manager: SM001
- Team Lead: TL001, TL002

```

**Features:**
- ✅ Auto-generated based on role
- ✅ Sequential numbering (001, 002, 003...)
- ✅ Unique and validated
- ✅ Shows in hierarchy page
- ✅ All 15 existing users assigned IDs
- ✅ New users get IDs automatically

**Database:**
```sql
users table:
  - employeeId: "ADV001" (unique)
  - firebaseUid: "abc123..." (still used for auth)
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Stock Quantity Tracking** ✅

**Before:**
```
zawlStock: true/false  (just yes/no)
rasStock: true/false
```

**After:**
```
zawlStock: 13 units
rasStock: 2 units
regionalStock: 4 units
plantStock: 9 units
totalStock: 28 units (auto-calculated)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Track actual quantities per location

- ✅ Update stock levels individually
- ✅ See total across all locations

**Current Stock:**
```
Total Vehicles: 5

- Toyota Camry: 27 units (ZAWL:8 RAS:4 Regional:1 Plant:14)
```

GET /api/stock?dealerId=dealer123
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Filter stock by dealer ID
- ✅ Each dealer manages their own inventory
- ✅ Multi-dealer support

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### Database Schema Updates:

**User Table:**
```sql

```

**Vehicle Table:**
```sql
+ modelId VARCHAR -- Link to Model
- zawlStock BOOLEAN → zawlStock INTEGER
- rasStock BOOLEAN → rasStock INTEGER
- regionalStock BOOLEAN → regionalStock INTEGER
- plantStock BOOLEAN → plantStock INTEGER
+ totalStock INTEGER -- Auto-calculated sum
```

**New Model Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE models (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  brand VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  modelName VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  segment VARCHAR,
  description TEXT,
  basePrice FLOAT,
  isActive BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  UNIQUE(brand, modelName)

## 💡 **How Everything Works Now**

### Employee Creation Flow:
```
1. Admin creates user:
   POST /api/auth/users/create-with-credentials
   Body: { name, email, password, roleName: "CUSTOMER_ADVISOR" }
   
2. Backend automatically:
   ✅ Creates Firebase user
   ✅ Generates employee ID: "ADV008"
   ✅ Creates DB record
   ✅ Returns: { employeeId: "ADV008", ... }
   
3. Employee can now:
   ✅ Login with email/password
   ✅ See their employee ID everywhere
   ✅ Be assigned to bookings by ID
```

### Stock Management Flow:
```
1. Admin adds vehicle:
   POST /api/stock
   Body: {
     variant: "Nexon XZ+",
     modelId: "model_id",
     dealerId: "dealer_id",
     zawlStock: 10,
     rasStock: 5,
     regionalStock: 3,
     plantStock: 2
   }
   
2. Backend automatically:
   ✅ Calculates totalStock = 20
   ✅ Links to model
   ✅ Links to dealer
   
3. When advisor converts enquiry:
   ✅ Checks totalStock > 0
   ✅ Creates booking if in stock
   ✅ Shows stock breakdown in response
```

### Dealer-Specific View:
```
Dealer A Dashboard:
  ✅ Sees only their 30 vehicles
  ✅ Stock: 250 units total
  
Dealer B Dashboard:
  ✅ Sees only their 20 vehicles
  ✅ Stock: 180 units total
  
Admin Dashboard:
  ✅ Sees ALL 50 vehicles
  ✅ Stock: 430 units total
```

### Model Structure:
```
Model: "Tata Nexon"
  ├─ Variant 1: "Nexon XZ+ Petrol AT" (Blue, 15 units)
  ├─ Variant 2: "Nexon XZ+ Diesel MT" (Red, 8 units)
  ├─ Variant 3: "Nexon EV Max" (White, 12 units)
  └─ Total: 35 units across 3 variants
```
