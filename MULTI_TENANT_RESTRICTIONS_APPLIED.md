# ✅ MULTI-TENANT RESTRICTIONS - ENFORCED

## 🎯 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Problem:** Admin users could create multiple dealerships, violating the multi-tenant model.

**Expected Behavior:** One ADMIN = One Dealership (strict enforcement)

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

---

## 🔒 **RESTRICTIONS APPLIED**

### **1. Dealership Creation**

**Old Behavior:**
```
❌ Any admin could create unlimited dealerships
❌ Admin A could create Dealership 1, 2, 3...
❌ No restriction on multiple dealership ownership
```

**New Behavior:**
```typescript
// POST /api/dealerships

if (req.user.dealershipId) {
  throw createError(
    'You are already managing a dealership. 
     In multi-tenant mode, each admin manages only one dealership.',
    403
  );
}

// After creating dealership:
await prisma.user.update({
  where: { firebaseUid: req.user.firebaseUid },
  data: { dealershipId: dealership.id }
});
// Admin is auto-assigned to the dealership they create
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Admin can only create ONE dealership
✅ After creation, admin is auto-assigned to that dealership
✅ Admin cannot create more dealerships (403 error)
✅ Complete multi-tenant enforcement
```

---

### **2. Dealership Listing**

**Old Behavior:**
```
❌ GET /api/dealerships returned ALL dealerships
❌ Admin A could see Dealership B, C, D...
❌ No isolation between admins
```

**New Behavior:**
```typescript
// GET /api/dealerships

// MULTI-TENANT: Filter by user's dealership
if (!req.user.dealershipId) {
  return { dealerships: [], total: 0 };
}

where.id = req.user.dealershipId;
// Returns ONLY the user's own dealership
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Admin A sees only Dealership A
✅ Admin B sees only Dealership B
✅ Complete data isolation
✅ Cannot view other dealerships
```

---

## 📊 **MULTI-TENANT WORKFLOW**

### **Scenario: Two Dealerships**

**Dealership A Setup:**
```
1. New admin signs up: admin@mumbaitata.com
2. Admin creates dealership:
   POST /api/dealerships
   {
     "name": "Mumbai Tata Motors",
     "code": "TATA-MUM-001",
     ...
   }
3. Admin auto-assigned: dealershipId = "dealership-A"
4. Admin creates users:
   - All users get dealershipId = "dealership-A"
5. Admin views dealerships:
   - Sees ONLY "Mumbai Tata Motors"
6. Admin tries to create another dealership:
   ❌ 403 Error: "Already managing a dealership"
```

**Dealership B Setup:**
```
1. Different admin signs up: admin@delhimahindra.com
2. Admin creates dealership:
   POST /api/dealerships
   {
     "name": "Delhi Mahindra",
     "code": "MAHINDRA-DEL-001",
     ...
   }
3. Admin auto-assigned: dealershipId = "dealership-B"
4. Admin creates users:
   - All users get dealershipId = "dealership-B"
5. Admin views dealerships:
   - Sees ONLY "Delhi Mahindra"
```

**Isolation:**
```
❌ Admin A CANNOT see Dealership B
❌ Admin B CANNOT see Dealership A
❌ Admin A CANNOT create more dealerships
❌ Admin B CANNOT create more dealerships
✅ Complete isolation enforced
```
