   - GENERAL_MANAGER
   - SALES_MANAGER
   - TEAM_LEAD
   - CUSTOMER_ADVISOR

2. **Database Schema**:
   - All tables and structure intact
   - All migrations preserved
   - All indexes and constraints intact

3. **Multi-Dealership System**:
   - `dealerships` table (empty but ready)
   - `vehicle_catalogs` table (empty but ready)
   - All dealership-related fields in tables

## 📝 **SCRIPTS CREATED**

The following cleanup scripts are now available for future use:

### **1. cleanup-all-data.ts**
- TypeScript script for database cleanup
- Deletes all test data while preserving roles
- Safe execution with foreign key handling

### **2. cleanup-firebase-users.js**
- JavaScript script for Firebase cleanup
- Batch deletes all users from Firebase Auth
- Detailed logging of each deletion

### **3. cleanup-database.sql**
- Direct SQL cleanup script
- Fast execution via psql
- Database-only cleanup

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

Your system is now clean! To set up fresh data:

### **Option 1: Create New Test Users**

```bash
# 1. Create Firebase users
node create-firebase-users.js

# 2. Create database users
node create-database-users.js
```

### **Option 2: Seed Sample Data**

```bash
# Seed sample dealership and catalog
npx ts-node prisma/seed-dealerships.ts
```

### **Option 3: Start Fresh**

You can now:
- Create new users via the admin dashboard
- Import bookings via CSV
- Set up real dealerships
- Configure vehicle catalogs

---

## 🔄 **RE-RUNNING CLEANUP**

To clean data again in the future:

```bash
# Complete cleanup (Database + Firebase)
npx ts-node cleanup-all-data.ts
node cleanup-firebase-users.js

# Or use SQL for faster database cleanup
psql $DATABASE_URL -f cleanup-database.sql
```

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES**

1. **Roles Preserved**: The 5 system roles were intentionally kept and are required for the application to function.

2. **Schema Intact**: All database tables, migrations, and structure remain intact - only data was removed.

3. **Production Safety**: These scripts are safe to use in development but should be used with extreme caution in production environments.

4. **No Undo**: This cleanup is permanent. There is no rollback functionality.
