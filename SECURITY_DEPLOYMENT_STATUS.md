## 🔄 Auto-Deployment Status

### If Using Render.com
Your code is pushed to GitHub. If you have Render configured:
1. Render will automatically detect the push
2. Build will start within 1-2 minutes
3. Deployment takes ~5-10 minutes
4. Check: https://dashboard.render.com/

**Build Command:** `npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build`  
**Start Command:** Migration + `npm start`

### If Using Vercel/Netlify (Frontend)
- Auto-deployment should trigger automatically
- Check your hosting dashboard for deployment status

### Manual Deployment (if auto-deploy not configured)
```bash
# Backend (Render)
# 1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
# 2. Click on your service
# 3. Click "Manual Deploy" > "Deploy latest commit"

# Frontend (Vercel)
# Run: vercel --prod

# Frontend (Netlify)
# Run: netlify deploy --prod
```

---

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### 1. Test Backend Authentication
```bash
# This should FAIL (no test-user bypass)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test-user" \
  https://your-backend-url.com/api/auth/profile

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized ✅
```

### 2. Test Admin Login
```bash
# Get Firebase token first
# Then use the admin panel

Email: admin@cardealership.com
Password: Admin123!

# Expected: Successful login with proper Firebase auth ✅
```

### 3. Verify API Requests
```bash
# All requests should include Firebase token
# Check browser console for:
# "🔑 [API CLIENT] Using Firebase token for: /api/..."

# NOT:
# "🔑 [API CLIENT] Using test-user bypass for: ..." ❌
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
**Check:** Build logs in Render dashboard  
**Common Issues:**
- Environment variables missing
- Prisma schema errors
- TypeScript compilation errors

**Fix:** Review logs and update code if needed

### Authentication Errors After Deploy
**Check:** Firebase configuration in environment variables  
**Required Env Vars:**
```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=car-dealership-app-9f2d5
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=<your-client-email>
DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
```

**Fix:** Add missing env vars in Render dashboard

### Admin Can't Login
**Possible Causes:**
1. Firebase user doesn't exist → Create in Firebase Console
2. Database entry missing → Run `npx ts-node create-test-admin.ts`
3. Role not assigned → Update user role in database
4. User inactive → Set `is_active = true`

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Create admin user
cd car-dealership-backend
npx ts-node create-test-admin.ts
```
