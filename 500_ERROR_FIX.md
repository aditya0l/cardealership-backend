# 500 Internal Server Error Fix - Missing Employee ID

## Date: October 13, 2025

---

## 🔴 Problem

After deploying the auto-user creation fix, users were getting **500 Internal Server Error** when trying to access any page/endpoint:

```
GET /api/bookings 500 (Internal Server Error)
❌ [BOOKINGS] API failed: AxiosError
```

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ Authentication working (Firebase token verified)
- ✅ User auto-created successfully  
- ❌ 500 error on all data fetching endpoints
- ❌ Happens on "opening any sort of page"

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Identified
The auto-created user was **missing the `employeeId` field**, which is:
1. Optional in the database schema (`employeeId String? @unique`)
2. But **expected by various controllers and queries**
3. Missing employee ID caused runtime errors in data fetching

### Why This Happened
In the initial auto-create implementation (`src/middlewares/auth.middleware.ts:160-167`):

```typescript
// ❌ MISSING employeeId
user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    firebaseUid: uid,
    email: email || `${uid}@firebase.user`,
    name: name || email?.split('@')[0] || 'Firebase User',
    roleId: role.id,
    isActive: true
    // ❌ No employeeId!
  }
});
```

### Impact
- Controllers expecting `employeeId` encountered null/undefined values
- Queries or filters using employee ID failed
- 500 errors returned to frontend
- All pages broken (bookings, enquiries, stocks, etc.)

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Generate Employee ID

**File:** `src/middlewares/auth.middleware.ts:156-174`

```typescript
// Create user in database
try {
  // ✅ Generate employee ID if needed
  const { generateEmployeeId } = await import('../utils/employee-id-generator');
  const employeeId = await generateEmployeeId(roleName);
  
  user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      firebaseUid: uid,
      employeeId,  // ✅ Now included!
      email: email || `${uid}@firebase.user`,
      name: name || email?.split('@')[0] || 'Firebase User',
      roleId: role.id,
      isActive: true
    },
    include: {
      role: true
    }
  });
  
  console.log(`✅ Auto-created user: ${user.email} (${employeeId}) with role ${user.role.name}`);
}
```

### Fix 2: Set Firebase Custom Claims

**File:** `src/middlewares/auth.middleware.ts:176-185`

```typescript
// ✅ Set custom claims in Firebase for consistency
try {
  await setUserClaims(uid, {
    role: user.role.name,
    roleId: user.role.id,
    employeeId: employeeId  // ✅ Include employee ID
  });
} catch (claimsError) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Failed to set custom claims, continuing...', claimsError);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Firebase user has complete role information
- Custom claims can be used for client-side role checks
- Consistent data between Firebase and database

---

## 📊 What Changed

### Before (Broken)
```typescript
Auto-created user = {
  firebaseUid: "abc123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  name: "User",
  roleId: "role-id-123",
  isActive: true,
  employeeId: null  // ❌ Missing!
}

Result: 500 errors on all endpoints
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
Auto-created user = {
  firebaseUid: "abc123",
  email: "user@example.com", 
  name: "User",
  roleId: "role-id-123",
  isActive: true,
  employeeId: "ADM001"  // ✅ Generated!
}

Firebase custom claims = {
  role: "ADMIN",
  roleId: "role-id-123",
  employeeId: "ADM001"  // ✅ Synced!
}

Result: All endpoints work correctly ✅
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Commit Information
```
Commit: 6a62cd9
Message: Fix: Add employeeId and custom claims to auto-created users
Branch: main
Pushed to: https://github.com/aditya0l/cardealership-backend
```

### Auto-Deployment
- **Hosting:** Render.com
- **Trigger:** Push to main branch
- **Build Time:** 5-10 minutes
- **URL:** https://automotive-backend-frqe.onrender.com

---

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment (5-10 min)
```bash
# Check deployment status
curl https://automotive-backend-frqe.onrender.com/api/health

# Expected response:
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-13..."}
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser and Login
1. **Clear browser cache** (important!)
2. **Logout** from admin panel
3. **Login again** with Firebase credentials
4. User will be auto-created with employee ID

### Step 3: Verify Employee ID
**Check backend logs:**
```
✅ Auto-created user: admin@example.com (ADM001) with role ADMIN
```

**Or query database:**
```sql
SELECT firebase_uid, email, employee_id, role_id 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';

-- Should show employee_id = 'ADM001' (or similar)
```

### Step 4: Test Data Fetching
```bash
# Test bookings endpoint
curl https://automotive-backend-frqe.onrender.com/api/bookings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIREBASE_TOKEN"

# Expected: 200 OK with data (or empty array if no bookings)
# NOT: 500 Internal Server Error
```

### Step 5: Test All Pages
- ✅ Bookings page loads
- ✅ Enquiries page loads
- ✅ Stocks page loads  
- ✅ Dashboard loads
- ✅ All data displays correctly

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 500 Errors?

**Check 1: Deployment Complete?**
```bash
curl https://automotive-backend-frqe.onrender.com/api/health
# Wait if deployment in progress
```

**Check 2: Clear Cache**
```
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button → Empty Cache and Hard Reload
3. Or: Close all tabs, clear cache, reopen
```

**Check 3: Re-login**
```
1. Logout from admin panel
2. Close browser
3. Reopen and login again
4. User will be re-created with employee ID
```

**Check 4: Check Render Logs**
```
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find: car-dealership-backend
3. View: Logs
4. Look for: Auto-created user messages
```

### Old Users Without Employee ID?

If you have users created before this fix:

**Option 1: Manual Update**
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET employee_id = 'ADM001'  -- or appropriate ID
WHERE email = 'user@example.com' 
  AND employee_id IS NULL;
```

**Option 2: Delete and Re-create**
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
-- Then login again to auto-create with employee ID
```

**Option 3: Run Migration Script**
```bash
# Create script to backfill employee IDs
npx ts-node scripts/backfill-employee-ids.ts
```
